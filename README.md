COVID-19 Live Updates in India via Notification and Graph
=========================================================

This will provide the live cases of coronovirus in the city you reside via notification on your desktop screen and also plot graphs of the Active Cases of all the Cities in India. It will also give you a text file and a pdf file which will contain all the details of COVID-19 cases of all the cities in India in form of table. And this whole thing will get updated when the program is re-run according to the stats of that time.

_In this i have used **PLYER** for notification._
_and used [API](https://api.covid19india.org/data.json) to get the live data of COVID-19 pandemic cases statewise._
_This will save a excel file in your current directory to see detailed stats of all states._
_This will also save a graph for the comparision between the states in terms of number of cases._
